POLYMIND: Local Knowledge Synthesis and Reasoning System

1. System Architecture Diagram and Description

Overview of the POLYMIND architecture, illustrating local pipeline components and data flow. The system is organized into modular stages operating entirely on local resources (no cloud services). First, a Text Ingestion module reads unstructured sources (e.g. Wikipedia dumps, Markdown documents) and passes the raw text to a Concept Extraction module. This extraction stage identifies key concepts or entities in the text and relationships between them (e.g. subject-predicate-object triples). The extracted concepts are then stored as nodes (with labeled relationships) in a Graph Database (a local Neo4j instance) forming a knowledge graph. In parallel, each concept (and possibly relational context) is converted into a vector representation via a local Embedding model, and these vectors are indexed in a Vector Store (FAISS) for fast similarity search. A Reasoning module sits atop these components to perform analogical queries and conceptual blending. It can retrieve candidates via vector similarity (analogical matching) or via graph queries/traversals (finding relational patterns). Finally, a lightweight Local UI (Streamlit or Gradio web app) provides an interactive chat interface for the user to query the system, and it also visualizes relevant portions of the concept graph.

Data Flow: When a user poses a query in the UI, the query is interpreted (potentially by a local LLM or simple heuristics) to determine which concepts or domains are involved. The system then triggers the Reasoning module: for example, to find an analogy for a given concept, it will look up that concept’s vector embedding and use FAISS to find the nearest neighbor concepts from a different domain (cross-domain analogs). It may also traverse the knowledge graph to ensure the analogy has a relational similarity (e.g. matching patterns of connections). The results (analogous concept(s) and an explanation or supporting subgraph) are returned and displayed: the UI might show a text explanation (via the LLM) and a graph subgraph highlighting the source concept and the analogous target concept with their linked neighbors. Throughout this process, all components run locally on the MacBook, ensuring data privacy and offline capability.

Use of a Local LLM: A small local Large Language Model (LLM) like Mistral-7B is integrated at two points (dashed lines in the diagram). First, the LLM can assist Concept Extraction by parsing raw text into structured triples or key phrases (via prompt-based parsing). Second, the LLM can support the Reasoning stage for conceptual blending or to generate natural language explanations of the analogies found. For example, after FAISS retrieves a candidate analogous concept, the LLM could be prompted (with the graph facts) to explain why that concept is analogous to the query. The LLM also powers the chat interface responses, making the system’s output more coherent and user-friendly. All LLM usage is local (e.g. running the Mistral model on-device), avoiding any cloud API dependency.

2. Best Offline Tools and Components

To fulfill the above design under the given constraints, we select proven open-source tools that run efficiently on a local MacBook (16GB RAM). Below are the recommended components for each part of the system, with rationale:
	•	Local LLM for Parsing & QA: Mistral 7B is a state-of-the-art 7-billion-parameter model released under an open license (Apache 2.0). Despite its relatively small size, Mistral-7B’s performance is on par or better than larger models like LLaMA-2 13B on many tasks ￼, making it a strong choice for local deployment. It can be used in two modes: (1) as a parser to extract concepts from text (with a suitable prompt, it can output JSON or triples), and (2) as a backend for the chat UI to answer questions using the knowledge graph. On a MacBook, Mistral 7B can run via CPU (with 4-bit quantization) or using Apple’s Metal GPU acceleration if on an M1/M2 chip. Tools like llama.cpp or Ollama can load a GGML-quantized Mistral model to serve it locally. (For instance, community feedback indicates that multiple 7B models or even a 13B model can run on a 16GB Mac with optimized runtimes ￼.) Alternative local LLMs: LLaMA-2 7B/13B, GPT4All, or Vicuna (if properly quantized) could also be used, but Mistral’s superior efficiency makes it preferred.
	•	Text Ingestion & Preprocessing: This can be handled with Python libraries. For Wikipedia content, Wikipedia API or offline dumps with a parser can be used. Markdown or text files can be read with standard file I/O. Splitting text into manageable chunks (for processing and LLM input) can be done with LangChain or NLTK (for sentence/paragraph tokenization). The ingestion step is straightforward and mostly relies on being able to stream or load large texts without exhausting memory (using generators or chunking as needed).
	•	Key Concept Extraction: To identify important concepts and relations from text without external APIs, we can combine lightweight NLP with local LLM parsing:
	•	Use spaCy (open-source NLP) for entity recognition and noun phrase extraction. SpaCy’s small English model can quickly find proper nouns, noun chunks, etc., as candidate concepts.
	•	Use KeyBERT or YAKE for keyword extraction as an alternative, which are unsupervised and local.
	•	For capturing relationships, one approach is to prompt the local LLM on each text chunk: e.g., “Extract all significant concepts and their relationships from the above text, in the form (Subject, Relationship, Object).” Mistral or another instruction-tuned model can output triples which we then parse. Projects have shown LLMs can reliably output knowledge triplets from text ￼ ￼.
	•	Another lightweight approach is rule-based: e.g., assume sentences containing known domain terms or capitalized words indicate a relationship (“X is a type of Y”, “X uses Y”, etc.). These can be regex patterns to extract simple relations.
	•	Graph Database (Knowledge Graph storage): Neo4j (Community Edition) is recommended for the structured storage. It’s a robust, ACID-compliant graph database that runs locally and comes with an interactive browser for visualization. Neo4j stores data as nodes and relationships, perfect for representing concepts (“nodes”) and the links between them (“edges”). It supports Cypher query language for expressive graph queries (e.g. find all paths between two concepts, or find all neighbors of a concept, etc.). Installation is straightforward – on macOS you can use Homebrew (brew install neo4j) or Docker (Neo4j provides an official image). The Neo4j Desktop app can also be used for a local DB with UI. With Neo4j, we can easily store cross-disciplinary knowledge: for example, one could label nodes with their domain (“Biology” vs “Philosophy”) and then query subgraphs by domain or mixed domains. The graph approach makes it easy to traverse relationships and find structural analogies (like “Concept A in biology is connected to X and Y, find a concept B in philosophy connected to analogous X’ and Y’”). This explicit relational reasoning complements vector-based similarity. As noted in literature, knowledge graphs provide structured, factual context to ground reasoning ￼, which helps avoid purely statistical or spurious analogies.
	•	Vector Store for Embeddings: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a proven library for fast vector similarity search on CPU. We use FAISS to index the embedding vectors of all concept nodes. It supports a variety of indexes; for ~50–100K concepts (for example) a flat L2 index or an HNSW index will give millisecond search times. FAISS is open-source and can be installed via pip (pip install faiss-cpu). We choose FAISS because it runs fully offline in-memory and is optimized in C++ under the hood. Alternative vector stores that are also local: ChromaDB (pure Python, can persist to disk), or Annoy (for approximate nearest neighbors). However, FAISS’s versatility and performance make it ideal. We will use cosine similarity or Euclidean distance in the embedding space to identify analogical matches (the assumption being that concepts that are analogous will occupy nearby positions in a semantically-informed vector space ￼).
	•	Embedding Model: We need a local embedding model to convert text concepts into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantics. While one could use the LLM itself for this (e.g. by taking an internal state or using a specific embedding head of the model), it’s better to use a model specifically fine-tuned for embeddings. State-of-the-art open models here include:
	•	E5 (Embeddings from Explicit Encoder) models – e.g. intfloat/e5-large-v2, or the smaller e5-base-v2. These are trained to produce 1024-dimensional sentence embeddings and have excellent performance on retrieval benchmarks.
	•	BGE (Beijing Gigaword Embedding) M3 – a 2.2B parameter multilingual model (may be too large for 16GB RAM unless quantized) but it has top-notch accuracy ￼.
	•	InstructorXL – a 1B+ model that allows using task instructions for embedding (also high performing but quite large).
	•	Mistral-based embeddings – notably, E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct, which fine-tunes Mistral 7B as an embedding model, is among the best on the MTEB benchmark ￼. If a quantized version is used, it could possibly run on a MacBook (with reduced precision).
	•	For efficiency, one could start with smaller Sentence-Transformers models such as all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (which is only 80MB, 384-dim vectors) or multi-qa-MiniLM-cos-v1. These have worse accuracy than larger models, but are very fast on CPU and would allow quick prototyping.
In summary, we recommend using sentence-transformers library with a medium-sized model (like all-mpnet-base-v2 or a distilled MiniLM) for initial development. As needed, one can swap in a better model (like E5-Large or E5-Mistral) if GPU resources become available or if performance is insufficient. The embeddings will enable cross-domain similarity search — for example, the vector for “gene” might be near the vector for “meme”, capturing an analogical similarity in meaning.
	•	Analogical Reasoning Engine: This is not an off-the-shelf tool but rather logic we implement using the graph and vector store. Two complementary approaches will be used:
	•	Vector-based Analogy: using the embedding space, find concepts in other domains with highest cosine similarity to a query concept’s vector. This yields candidates that “feel” similar in meaning. For example, the famous analogy “man is to king as woman is to queen” can be discovered by vector math in a well-trained embedding space ￼. In our case, we may find “gene” (biology) is closest to “meme” (cultural concept) in vector space, suggesting an analogy.
	•	Graph-based Analogy: using the knowledge graph, find subgraph patterns. For instance, if Concept A has relationships A→X, A→Y, and A is of type T, we can query the graph for Concept B in a different domain that has relationships B→X’, B→Y’ with analogous X’,Y’ and B is of type T’ (some analogous type). This requires either (a) a schema/ontology mapping between domains, or (b) brute-force search of subgraph isomorphisms. Given our scale, a simple approach is to look at a concept’s immediate neighbors and try to match neighbor labels. (E.g., “heart” is a biological organ that pumps blood and connects to “circulation”; an analog in technology might be “pump” or “engine” that moves fluid, connecting to “hydraulics”.) Neo4j’s Cypher queries or Graph Data Science library could help find similar connectivity patterns. However, this can get complex; we will likely focus on vector analogies first and use the graph more for validating or explaining the analogies (by retrieving the neighborhood of each concept to show to the user).
	•	UI and Visualization: We will use Streamlit (or Gradio) to build a simple web-based interface. Both are pure Python and run locally in a browser. Streamlit allows mixing text, interactive widgets, and even charts/plots easily. Gradio is great for quick chat interfaces. We’ll implement a chat-like interface where the user can enter queries in natural language (e.g. “What in philosophy is analogous to DNA?”). Upon submission, the system will run the reasoning and then display:
	•	A text answer (constructed by the LLM or a template) explaining the analogous concept found.
	•	A visualization of the knowledge graph highlighting the relevant nodes. For graph visualization, we can use libraries like NetworkX (to create a subgraph and draw it with Matplotlib) or PyVis to generate an interactive HTML. In Streamlit, we can simply output a Matplotlib figure or use st.graphviz_chart if we output GraphViz DOT of the subgraph. Neo4j’s browser is another option (for manual exploration), but for the custom UI we’ll likely generate an image or use an embedded D3 component.
Streamlit is installed with pip install streamlit and launched via streamlit run app.py. It can display images and use custom components. Gradio (pip install gradio) can similarly launch a local web app with an interface function. Both are easy to set up and do not require cloud services. We will provide example code for a Streamlit implementation.

Now that the design and tools are chosen, we proceed with prototype code snippets for each major functionality.

3. Prototype Implementation Code

Below, we provide simplified Python code segments for core functionalities: ingesting text and extracting concepts, loading into Neo4j, generating embeddings, and performing analogical searches. These are meant as starting points and can be expanded.

3.1 Ingest Text and Extract Key Concepts

In this example, we’ll use spaCy to extract noun phrases and named entities from a given text. For illustration, assume text contains a Wikipedia article or a document. We identify candidate concepts as proper nouns or meaningful noun chunks, and we also attempt to extract simple relationships by looking for patterns in sentences. (For a more advanced extraction, one could use the local LLM with a prompt, but spaCy + heuristics is faster and fully local.)

import spacy

# Load a lightweight English model for spaCy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = """DNA is a molecule that carries genetic instructions in living organisms. 
In philosophy of mind, the meme is often described as a unit of cultural information."""  # example mixed-domain text

doc = nlp(text)

# Extract candidate concepts: noun chunks and entities
concepts = set()
for np in doc.noun_chunks:
    # Simple filtering: ignore very common words or short chunks
    phrase = np.text.strip()
    if len(phrase) > 2 and not np.root.is_stop:
        concepts.add(phrase)
for ent in doc.ents:
    concepts.add(ent.text.strip())

print("Extracted concepts:", concepts)
# Example output: {'DNA', 'molecule', 'genetic instructions', 'living organisms', 
#                 'philosophy of mind', 'meme', 'unit', 'cultural information'}

In a real scenario, we would refine this list. For instance, “genetic instructions” and “unit” above might not be standalone concepts we want to keep. We could filter by checking frequency or knowledge base: e.g., cross-check if the candidate appears as a Wikipedia title or in a controlled vocabulary. We might also normalize concepts (e.g., singularize nouns, capitalize consistently).

Using LLM for relationships: We can complement the above by identifying relationships. For example, scan for verbs between noun phrases or use dependency parsing. Alternatively, use the LLM:

from transformers import pipeline

# Suppose we have a local pipeline (using a small model or Mistral via text-generation)
extractor = pipeline("text-generation", model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct", device=-1)
prompt = "Extract factual triples (subject; relationship; object) from the text:\n" + text + "\nTriples:"
result = extractor(prompt, max_length=256, do_sample=False)
triples_text = result[0]['generated_text']
print(triples_text)
# Example (idealized) output:
# DNA; carries; genetic instructions
# DNA; exists in; living organisms
# meme; is; unit of cultural information

In practice, one would need to craft the prompt and possibly fine-tune the model to reliably output triples. The above pipeline is illustrative; running a 7B model on CPU for generation will be slow (minutes per request), so for development one might test with a smaller model or just use the spaCy approach.

3.2 Loading Concepts into a Graph Database (Neo4j)

After extraction, we have a set of concept strings and perhaps some relations. We next insert them into Neo4j. We can use Neo4j’s Bolt protocol via the py2neo library or Neo4j Python driver. Below, we show how to create nodes and relationships using Cypher queries. (Ensure Neo4j is running locally at bolt://localhost:7687 and you’ve set the username/password in the code.)

from py2neo import Graph

# Connect to Neo4j (assumes you've set NEO4J_AUTH user/pass or use default neo4j/neo4j)
graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

# First, create unique Concept nodes for each concept
for concept in concepts:
    tx = graph.begin()
    # Using MERGE to avoid duplicates if run multiple times
    tx.run("MERGE (:Concept {name: $name, domain: $domain})", 
           name=concept, 
           domain="Biology" if concept in biology_list else "Philosophy")
    tx.commit()

# If we have extracted relationships (triples), create relationships
triples = [
    ("DNA", "CARRIES", "genetic instructions"),
    ("DNA", "IN", "living organisms"),
    ("meme", "IS_A", "unit of cultural information")
]
for subj, rel, obj in triples:
    tx = graph.begin()
    tx.run("""
        MATCH (s:Concept {name: $sub}), (o:Concept {name: $obj})
        MERGE (s)-[r:%s]->(o)
    """ % rel, sub=subj, obj=obj)
    tx.commit()

In the above:
	•	We assign a domain property to each Concept node (so we know which domain it belongs to, e.g., Biology or Philosophy).
	•	We then use example triples to create relationships. In Cypher, MERGE (s)-[r:TYPE]->(o) creates a relationship of type TYPE between existing nodes s and o. We parameterize the relationship type via Python string formatting (ensuring it’s a valid label, like CARRIES or IS_A – by convention relationship types are uppercase). In a real extractor, the relation strings might be verbs or phrases which need mapping to a simpler form.

Install notes: Install Neo4j Desktop and set a password for the default database. Install py2neo (pip install py2neo). Ensure the Neo4j server is running (neo4j start if using the command-line). If using Neo4j 5+, you might use the official neo4j Python driver instead. You can test connectivity by running a simple query like graph.run("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)").data().

3.3 Generating Embeddings for Concepts

Now, we generate vector embeddings for each concept name (or a fuller description, if available). We’ll use Sentence-Transformers for simplicity in this snippet. In practice, ensure the model is downloaded only once and reused (loading the model is the slow part; encoding many items is fairly fast).

!pip install sentence-transformers   # ensure the library is installed
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Use a compact model for demonstration.
embed_model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Prepare a list of concept names to embed
concept_list = list(concepts)
embeddings = embed_model.encode(concept_list, convert_to_numpy=True)  # shape: (N, 384)

# (Optional) Store embeddings in a vector store (like FAISS)
import faiss
dim = embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dim)  # cosine similarity via Inner Product if vectors are normalized
# If not normalized, use IndexFlatL2 for Euclidean.
faiss.normalize_L2(embeddings)  # normalize if using IP for cosine
index.add(embeddings)
print(f"Indexed {index.ntotal} concept vectors.")

This code will produce a vector for each concept. For example, the concept “DNA” might end up as a 384-dimensional vector. We chose IndexFlatIP (inner product) for FAISS which, after normalization of vectors, effectively does cosine similarity search ￼ ￼. The index is in-memory; for persistence, we could save embeddings array and an id->concept mapping, or use FAISS’s write_index to save to disk.

Memory note: 50 concepts × 384 dims is trivial. Even 50k concepts × 768 dims would be only ~150 MB of floats – fine for 16GB RAM. FAISS can handle millions of vectors on CPU if needed.

3.4 Analogical Search (Finding Similar Concepts)

With the vector index ready, we can answer analogical queries by finding nearest neighbors across domains. Suppose the user asks: “What is analogous to DNA in philosophy?” We interpret this as: take the vector for “DNA” (a biology concept) and search for the closest concept vector among those in the philosophy domain. We then return the top hit(s).

# Define domain filters – for demo, separate indices or post-filter by domain
# E.g., create an array of domain labels aligned with concept_list
domains = ["Biology" if c in biology_list else "Philosophy" for c in concept_list]

# Function to find analogies: given a concept, find nearest neighbor in the other domain
import numpy as np

def find_analogous_concept(query):
    if query not in concept_list:
        return None
    q_idx = concept_list.index(query)
    q_vec = embeddings[q_idx]
    faiss.normalize_L2(np.expand_dims(q_vec, 0))
    D, I = index.search(np.expand_dims(q_vec, 0), k=5)  # find 5 nearest neighbors
    neighbors = [concept_list[i] for i in I[0]]
    # Filter out any neighbor in the same domain as query, and also filter the query itself
    query_domain = domains[q_idx]
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        if neighbor != query and domains[concept_list.index(neighbor)] != query_domain:
            return neighbor
    return None

analog = find_analogous_concept("DNA")
print("Analogous concept to DNA:", analog)
# Expected output (with the toy data): "meme" (since 'meme' was in philosophy domain)

In the above find_analogous_concept, we:
	•	Locate the query concept’s vector.
	•	Perform a FAISS search for nearest neighbors.
	•	Iterate the results to return the first one that belongs to a different domain than the query. In a more robust implementation, you might take the top N results and then perhaps ask the LLM to pick which is the best analogy, or return multiple analogies.

For a graph-based reasoning approach, an alternative is to use the Neo4j graph. For example, one heuristic: find the types of relationships around the query node, then search for a node in the other domain that has a similar relationship pattern. If our graph had type labels or ontologies, we could do more. For simplicity:

# Example graph traversal: find a path connecting a Biology concept to a Philosophy concept
query = "DNA"
target_domain = "Philosophy"
query_result = graph.run("""
    MATCH (start:Concept {name:$name, domain:'Biology'}), 
          (target:Concept {domain:$dom}), 
          p=shortestPath((start)-[*..3]-(target))
    RETURN target.name AS analogous, length(p) AS hops
    ORDER BY hops
    LIMIT 1
""", name=query, dom=target_domain).data()
print(query_result)

This Cypher query tries to find the closest Philosophy-domain node to the “DNA” node via any relationship path up to length 3. If a direct or 2-step connection exists linking DNA to some philosophy concept, it would find it. In many cases, there may be no direct graph path (our two domains might be disjoint or only weakly connected unless we manually added bridging nodes). The vector method doesn’t require an existing link – it works on semantic similarity.

Expected Outputs: When testing these components on a mini dataset (to be described in section 5), we should see:
	•	Concept extraction printing a list of concept strings.
	•	Neo4j being populated (you can query Neo4j browser to verify nodes and relationships).
	•	The embedding model generating vectors (not human-interpretable, but you can print the shape or a snippet of the array).
	•	The FAISS search returning plausible analogies. For example, with a concept “cell” (biology), it might return something like “monad” or “atom” from philosophy if those were in the dataset, etc.
	•	The graph query approach would find connections if any were encoded.

We have now built the core pipeline: ingest -> graph -> embeddings -> analogy search. Next, we integrate this into a user-facing interface.

4. Streamlit UI for Querying and Visualization

Below is an example Streamlit app code that ties everything together. It allows a user to input a query in a chat box, processes the query by calling the functions above, and displays the result and a simple graph visualization. We assume all prior steps (graph and FAISS index creation) have been done and the objects (graph, index, etc.) are in memory or accessible. In practice, one might load a pre-built index from disk and connect to Neo4j at app startup.

import streamlit as st
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# (Assume concept_list, domains, embeddings, index, graph from previous steps are available)

st.title("POLYMIND Chat Interface")
st.markdown("Ask a question or seek an analogy between concepts:")

user_query = st.text_input("Enter your query (e.g. 'Analogy for DNA in philosophy?')")

if user_query:
    # Very naive parsing of query:
    # If query contains the word "analogy" or "analogous" and a domain keyword, parse accordingly.
    query_words = user_query.lower().split()
    if "analog" in " ".join(query_words):
        # find concept in query (assume first capitalized word is the concept for simplicity)
        import re
        concept_match = re.search(r"[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+", user_query)
        if concept_match:
            concept = concept_match.group(0)
            analog = find_analogous_concept(concept)
            if analog:
                # Compose answer
                answer = f"In {domains[concept_list.index(analog)]}, an analogous concept to **{concept}** might be **{analog}**."
                st.write(answer)
                # Show a small subgraph around the two concepts
                subG = nx.Graph()
                subG.add_node(concept, domain=domains[concept_list.index(concept)])
                subG.add_node(analog, domain=domains[concept_list.index(analog)])
                # Add neighbors of each from Neo4j (up to 1-hop) for context
                for node in [concept, analog]:
                    results = graph.run("MATCH (n:Concept {name:$name})-[:*1]-(m) RETURN m.name AS neigh, m.domain AS dom", 
                                        name=node).data()
                    for record in results:
                        neigh = record['neigh']; dom = record['dom']
                        subG.add_node(neigh, domain=dom)
                        subG.add_edge(node, neigh)
                # Draw the graph
                pos = nx.spring_layout(subG)
                plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
                node_colors = ["skyblue" if subG.nodes[n]['domain']=="Biology" else "salmon" for n in subG.nodes]
                nx.draw(subG, pos, with_labels=True, node_color=node_colors, font_size=8)
                st.pyplot(plt.gcf())
            else:
                st.write(f"Sorry, I couldn't find an analogy for **{concept}**.")
    else:
        # For non-analogy questions, we might default to a simple lookup or LLM answer
        st.write("This prototype currently supports only analogy queries.")

In this Streamlit app:
	•	We display a title and an input box.
	•	When the user enters a query, we rudimentarily check if it’s asking for an analogy. (In a full solution, we’d use an LLM to interpret the query.)
	•	We extract the concept of interest and call find_analogous_concept (from section 3.4).
	•	If an analogy is found, we display an answer highlighting the analogous concept. Then we construct a small NetworkX graph subG containing the two concepts and their neighbors (one-hop connections) from the Neo4j knowledge graph. We color nodes by domain (e.g., biology in blue, philosophy in red) for clarity. The graph is drawn with Matplotlib and shown via st.pyplot().
	•	If the query is not understood or no analogy is found, we handle it gracefully.

Running the App: Save this code as polymind_app.py. Run streamlit run polymind_app.py. A browser will open (or visit localhost:8501) showing the interface. Try queries like “What is analogous to DNA in philosophy?” – the app should respond with something like “In Philosophy, an analogous concept to DNA might be meme.” and display a mini-graph linking DNA to “genetic instructions” etc., and meme to its context.

Note: In this prototype, the logic is simple and primarily based on our small dataset and embedding similarities. The LLM isn’t explicitly called in the Streamlit code except for the possibility of parsing the query. In a more advanced version, after finding the analogous concept, you might prompt the LLM to generate a nicer explanation (e.g., “DNA carries genetic information for biological organisms, and analogously, in cultural terms, a meme carries informational content that propagates in a society.”). This can be done with a local language model like Mistral by providing a prompt template with the found analogy and its descriptions from the graph. The response can then be displayed.

5. Mini Test Dataset (Biology & Philosophy Domains)

We construct a small knowledge base of ~50 concepts from two domains – Biology and Philosophy – to test cross-disciplinary reasoning. Below are example concepts in each domain. (In a real scenario, these could be drawn from Wikipedia articles in each field.)

Biology Domain – example concepts:
	•	DNA
	•	Cell
	•	Evolution
	•	Natural selection
	•	Gene
	•	Protein
	•	Photosynthesis
	•	Mitosis
	•	Ecosystem
	•	Symbiosis
	•	Homeostasis
	•	Neuron

(The dataset can be extended; we aim for diversity. We included “meme” as it’s directly analogous to “gene” – coined by Richard Dawkins to describe a unit of cultural evolution, deliberately mirroring biological genes.)

Relationships in the dataset: For a richer graph, we can add a few cross-domain links and within-domain links:
	•	Within biology: e.g., (DNA) -[codes for]-> (Protein); (Gene) -[subconcept of]-> (DNA); (Neuron) -[part of]-> (Brain), etc.
	•	Within philosophy: e.g., (Dualism) -[opposed to]-> (Monism) (if we add Monism); (Dialectic) -[developed by]-> (Hegel) (if persons included), etc.
	•	Cross-domain (for analogy support): We might not add many explicit cross links (to let the system find them via embeddings), but we could indicate correspondences as separate knowledge: e.g., a special relationship ANALOGOUS_TO: (Gene) -[ANALOGOUS_TO]-> (Meme) in the graph, so that a graph traversal query could find that directly. Similarly, maybe (Evolution) -[ANALOGOUS_TO]-> (Dialectical change) if we consider Hegelian dialectics analogous to evolution of ideas.

Having around 50 nodes and a handful of edges, one can manually input these into Neo4j (via Cypher CREATE queries or using the code as shown). The embeddings for these will cluster some pairs together (Gene–Meme likely close in vector space due to shared “unit of information” semantics, Cell–Monad perhaps to some degree, etc.). This dataset is sufficient to demonstrate the system’s ability to find analogies.

6. Future Work: Conceptual Blending and Abductive Reasoning

Designing POLYMIND as above provides a foundation for analogical reasoning. However, deeper forms of reasoning like conceptual blending and abductive inference require further enhancements. Here we outline how future iterations can incorporate these, along with pointers to relevant research:
	•	Conceptual Blending: This refers to merging elements from two or more concept spaces to form new ideas, as described by Fauconnier and Turner’s cognitive blending theory ￼. In our context, conceptual blending could mean generating a novel concept that “blends” features of a biology concept and a philosophy concept. For example, blending “natural selection” (biology) with “ethics” (philosophy) could yield the idea of “evolutionary ethics” (a real field considering how evolution informs moral principles). Supporting this in an automated way is challenging. One approach is to use the LLM to generate candidates: prompt it with something like “Combine concept A and concept B into a creative new concept or metaphor, and describe it.” The knowledge graph can help ensure the blend is meaningful by providing attributes of A and B that the LLM should integrate. Recent research has explored using structured knowledge to guide such blending. For instance, PopBlends (Wang et al., 2023) introduced methods for blending fictional concepts by finding connecting concepts and using embedding-based similarity as a guide ￼. They show that knowledge graphs and word embeddings can aid the divergent thinking step of brainstorming by highlighting associations between concepts ￼. We can draw from these ideas: implementing a blending module that takes two input nodes from different domains, retrieves their neighborhood graphs (attributes, related concepts), and uses an LLM to generate a candidate blended concept. That new concept could even be added to the graph as a node (possibly linked to both original nodes via a “blend-of” relationship). This begins to approach creativity, moving beyond finding existing analogies to proposing new synthesized knowledge.
	•	Abductive Reasoning: Abduction is inference to the best explanation – i.e., given some observations, hypothesize a concept or relationship that would explain them. In a knowledge graph context, this could mean: given two seemingly distant concepts, find a plausible concept that connects them. For example, if our graph shows “A causes X” and “B causes X” as observations, an abductive hypothesis might be “Perhaps A and B are related (e.g., A influences B) to explain why they both cause X.” Implementing abductive reasoning may involve graph algorithms and the LLM. One could use Neo4j’s path-finding or rule-mining (e.g., via the Graph Data Science library) to suggest a missing link. There is active research on abductive reasoning with knowledge graphs ￼. One study introduces generating logical hypotheses on KGs to explain a set of observations, using a transformer model plus reinforcement learning to refine the hypotheses ￼ ￼. In POLYMIND, a simpler approach could be:
	•	Take a query like “Why might X and Y be similar?” or “What could explain phenomenon Z?”.
	•	Search the graph for paths or common neighbors between the entities involved (this finds explicit connections).
	•	If none, use the embedding space to find a concept that is close to both X and Y, as a potential “bridge”. That concept can be proposed as a hypothesis.
	•	Use the LLM to phrase the hypothesis in natural language: e.g., “It could be that Q is a common factor linking X and Y, because Q is related to both (according to the knowledge graph).”
This way, the system attempts an explanatory analogy or an hypothesized new link. As our knowledge graph grows, the ability to perform such reasoning improves. In the future, integrating a logical reasoner (even a simple rule-based engine or a description logic reasoner if we formalize the ontology) could allow verifying or suggesting new relationships.
	•	Neuro-Symbolic Integration: A promising direction for both blending and abductive reasoning is combining neural and symbolic methods. Our current system already mixes vector-based (neural embeddings) and graph-based (symbolic relations) reasoning. We can push this further by using the LLM (neural) to handle creativity and language, while using the graph (symbolic) to enforce consistency and recall factual links. Research like Conceptual Blending in AI suggests formalizing blends via ontologies and then using search to find blend candidates ￼. Also, analogical reasoning research (e.g., Gentner’s structure-mapping theory ￼) indicates that true analogy depends on mapping relational structure, not just surface features – thus motivating more graph-based pattern matching in our system to complement embedding similarity.
	•	Scaling and Optimization: To keep within one developer’s 2-3 week implementation scope on local compute, some compromises were made (e.g., using smaller models, limiting data size). In future, one could experiment with larger local models as they become available (for instance, if a 13B or 20B model is still feasible on a high-end Mac with 16GB unified memory using 4-bit quantization). Also, as data grows, one might integrate an on-disk database for vectors (FAISS can be memory-mapped, or use ChromaDB with SQLite for persistence). Neo4j can handle millions of nodes on a local machine, but query performance might require adding indexes or using Graph Data Science library algorithms for more complex reasoning.

Installation & Usage Recap: To build this prototype, ensure you install all required packages:
	•	Python 3.10+ (for compatibility with PyTorch/Transformers and Neo4j drivers).
	•	pip install spacy py2neo neo4j transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu streamlit networkx matplotlib (and others as needed like pygraphviz if using GraphViz, etc.).
	•	Download or install Neo4j locally. Set it up and note the Bolt URL and credentials.
	•	(Optional) Download a quantized Mistral 7B model if planning to use the LLM for extraction/explanations (e.g., via the Hugging Face Hub or a torrent). This might be ~4GB for 4-bit quant. Ensure you have transformers and maybe accelerate installed. You can load the model with AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...) and generate within the Streamlit app if needed (though this will be slow without a GPU).
	•	Run Neo4j and Streamlit as described above.

After following these steps, you should be able to interact with POLYMIND on your local machine. You can ingest your own text (replace the example text with actual Wikipedia content to expand the graph), and then query for cross-domain insights. The expected outcome is that the system will successfully retrieve analogies (with the caveat that the quality depends on the embedding model’s semantic understanding) and display a visualization linking the concepts, thereby validating the approach of knowledge synthesis through a “cognitive graph” of meaning atoms.

Neo4j’s official blogs on Graph-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) are useful for integrating graphs with local LLMs ￼.
	•	Analogical Reasoning: For understanding analogies, see Gentner’s classic Structure-Mapping Theory ￼ which argues true analogy is about relational similarity (our system could incorporate this by checking graph structures). Also, Mikolov et al.’s work on word embeddings demonstrated vector arithmetic analogies ￼, inspiring our use of embedding similarity. A recent Medium article by Dickson Lukose (2024) covers analogical reasoning in LLMs and lists some tools; while many are symbolic, hybrid approaches are emerging.
	•	Conceptual Blending: Fauconnier & Turner’s book “The Way We Think” (2002) lays the theory’s foundation ￼. On the AI side, a paper by Veale and Martin (2013) discusses computational conceptual blending, and the PopBlends system (CHI 2023) mentioned earlier uses LLMs plus knowledge bases for creative blends ￼.
	•	Abductive Reasoning: A 2024 ACL paper by Zhang et al. introduces abductive reasoning on KGs ￼ – they use a generative model to propose hypotheses that explain given facts, and refine them with reinforcement learning on the graph. This is an advanced technique, but the motivation is aligned with POLYMIND’s goals: to go beyond retrieving facts to explaining and connecting them in novel ways. Another relevant concept is abductive commonsense reasoning, exemplified by the ARC dataset (though that’s more text-based; in a KG context, we focus on structural explanations).

By building on this solid base and incorporating these research insights, POLYMIND can evolve from a simple analogical Q&A system to a powerful tool for cross-domain creativity and reasoning – all running locally and privately.
